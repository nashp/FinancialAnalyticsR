Recently discovered errata:
p. 90  Exercise 5.2 sigmaZ should be .0007
p. 130 line 8 'pass' should be 'passer'
p. 158 Paragraph 3 5th formula demonimator sigma_e^2 should be (sigma_e)^2.
p. 158 Paragraph 3 Cov(X,Y) sigma_XY = sigma_X sigmaY rho should be Cov(X,Y) = sigma_XY = sigma_X sigmaY rho.
p. 200 'Formula 7.3' should be 'Formula 9.3'
p. 224 'Sigma^T = Omega 2' lines from bottom should be 'Sigma^(-1) = Omega'.
p. 271 Figure 11.6 has duplicated arcs from state -1 to states -.75 and -.50
       that should be combined into single arc named 'exit position expected gain'
       and 'exit position expected loss'.
p. 271 Figure 11.6 has duplicated arcs from state +1 to states +.75 and +.50
       that should be combined into single arc named 'exit position expected gain'
       and 'exit position expected loss'.

The code for each Chapter is in a file called code.R.
Associated datasets are also contained in each directory. 

Ticker symbols contained in literal constants in the book do become obsolete occasionally.
The most common event that causes this is when these publicly traded companies are acquired.
The tseries package routine get.hist.quote() will no longer quote prices
after this happens even though the prices existed up until the acquisition.

In order to approximate the book results, it is best to replace the ticker that
was absorbed (and no longer quoted) with the surviving ticker. During 2016 these
ticker changes occurred and the code.R files have been updated accordingly.
